                    <p>Beginning with the Puddle Jumper, and retaining its performance defining rocker and spiral vee under the rear foot,
                    I pushed the wide point slightly forward, widened and squared off the tail block and really pulled in/straightened
                    out the hip area of the outline, between the feet. These changes, combined with reducing the depth of the concave
                    through the center of the board (which straightens and flattens the rail rocker under the front foot) all work
                    together to build a more linear speed down the line, across flats and though slop. The inverted swallow, and
                    angular corners of the square tail, reduces surface area behind the rear foot, adding bite and control without
                    sacrificing the extreme drive generated by the straight tail outline and rail rocker. The entire design is wrapped
                    up with the (optional) speed bleeding, “afterburner”,  release channel, which sits inside the double concave vee
                    panels and is toed in slightly, to run parallel with the rear quad fin placement. The channel then exits  at the
                    apex of the inverted swallow. My goal was to design a board that matches the flat line speed of any alternative
                    “fish” design, without the cumbersome, drifty feeling most of these boards possess, and allow full force, small wave,
                    rail surfing with confidence.
